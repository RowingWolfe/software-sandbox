Yeah, I should write this when I get a moment. This is mostly a work project while I read some books on C and maybe try some stuff out? I look forward the the sections on interprocess communication and also will be doing some arduino stuff probably in here. I have a ton of esp8266s and 32s and arduino unos wow look at that spaghetti already.

Started out trying to get back into C++ but realized "We must go deeper." I figure I start here and work my way through ASM for whatever processors I have on hand (I got a z80, there an ASM dev env for that? Could be an excuse to build that breadboard computer I got all those parts for.)

Eventually I want to work on building stuff in FPGAs, that could be real interesting going forward... hardware defined by software...

Anyway, that's some notes... you might see some C++ projects, maybe even ASM? I'll try to keep them self-contained in folders. There might be some python even, if I need to write a quick API in flask or something or a quick CRUD app in Django to support the other projects that may need web backends.

Slight chance of godot projects showing up here as well if I want to do something weird with a UI. (I kinda like the UI system and I could write C addons to extend it with GDnative.) So I could effectively use Godot as a UI frontend, right? With cross compiling and compatability? Eh wot? So if I do any of that stuff I will likely do the figuring out for it here.
